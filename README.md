Football Player Selection Analysis

**Introduction:**
The Football Player Selection Analysis project aims to assist the management of the newly established football club, GL United FC, in making data-driven decisions regarding player selection for their team. Using a dataset obtained from FIFA containing details of over 18,000 players, this analysis provides insights into player attributes, performance, and club affiliations to identify potential players for the main team.

**Project Overview:**

**Data Exploration: **The project starts with loading and exploring the dataset, which includes checking sample data, data shape, and information about different features. Redundant columns like 'Photo', 'Flag', and 'Club Logo' are dropped to streamline the analysis process.
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This step involves cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. Columns like "Value", "Wage", and "Release Clause" are converted to float data type after removing currency symbols and suffixes. Other columns like "Joined" and "Contract Valid Until" are converted to appropriate data types. Missing values are also handled using suitable imputation techniques.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset. The distribution of Overall ratings for all players is visualized, and the top 20 players based on Overall rating are identified. A dataframe containing information about these top players is generated, and their average age and wage are calculated. Further analysis includes determining the player with the highest wage among the top 20, finding the average overall rating for each club, visualizing the relationship between age and individual potential, identifying factors contributing to player wages, determining player positions with maximum and minimum representation, and analyzing the number of players from the club 'Juventus' with a wage greater than 200K.
**Conclusion:** The project concludes by generating a dataframe containing the top 5 players by Overall rating for each unique position and calculating the average wage for the top 5 players in every position.
